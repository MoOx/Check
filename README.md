# _Check_

Fake todo app management for a technical test _made in less than 4 hours_

## What I use
+ A bit of HTML5,
+ Lots of CSS 3, using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) / [Compass](http://compass-style.org) & [Compass Recipes](http://moox.github.com/compass-recipes/)
+ Javascript with jQuery & JSON

### Front-end
An API is written in javascript, & a jQuery plugin make the
DOM using the api when event we update the document.

### Back-end
_There is no real backend, the javascript API call a static json each time. But it's now really simple to create this layer, since every action is send to the same url !_

### TODO

There is always something todo, to improve.
In this case, we can polish the UI, add some effects & for example save todo list on localStorage !

### Browser support

Only tested with recent Webkit & Gecko

#### Licence
Under WTFPL
